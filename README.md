# Scenario-Test-Software-Engineer-Backend

The backend service would expose a set of REST API endpoints that enables a user to:
• Create, retrieve, update and delete applications they own.
• Associate a subscription with a pricing plan (from a preconfigured list of pricing plans)
• Read the subscription details for an app
• Update the subscription for an app
The user would also need to be able to register, login and reset their password.
